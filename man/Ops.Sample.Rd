\title{ Basic Operations for Sample Objects }
\description{
These functions apply the basic operations pointwise to the waveforms of the samples.

\synopsis{
Ops.Sample(s1,s2)
sum.Sample(s1,s2,...)
prod.Sample(s1,s2,...)
}
\usage{s1 + s2
s1 - s2
s1 * s2
const * s
s * const
s / const
sum.Sample(s1, s2, ...)
prod.Sample(s1, s2, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{s, s1, s2, \dots}{ For \code{+},\code{-},\code{*},\code{/}, Sample objects. For \code{prod.Sample} and \code{sum.Sample}, Sample objects or strings giving the names of wav files. }
  \item{const}{ a double. }
}
\details{
The sum of two Sample objects corresponds to the sound when both samples are played at a time. The product of two samples causes an effect called ringmodulation, but it can also be used to add some vibrato to a sound (see the examples).

If the samples have different sample parameters (bits, rate and channels), the system uses the command \code{\link{fitSampleParameters}} to adjust them before the waveforms are combined.

Be careful to make sure that the resulting waveform does not exceed the interval [-1,1] when it is played or saved to disk, otherwise you will lose information and hear cracks in the sound. To avoid this, you can use \code{const * s} or the \code{\link{normalize}} command.

In \code{prod} and \code{sum} also the names of wavefiles can be used. Other forms like \code{s1+s2} do not accept filenames as arguments. If the first argument \code{s1} is a filename, the explicit forms \code{sum.Sample} and \code{prod.Sample} must be used.
